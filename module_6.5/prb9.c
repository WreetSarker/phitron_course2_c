    Fizzbuzz is a very well known problem. Given a positive integer N, you need to print n lines.
        For multiples of 3, you should print Fizz.

        For the multiples of 5, you should print Buzz.

        For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, print “FizzBuzz”.

        In other cases, print the current line number.

        Example

        Input: 5

        Output:

            1

            2

            Fizz

            4

            Buzz
